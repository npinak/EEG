MATLAB code of the EEG projects that I've done. Please take a look. 


EEG Signal-Simulation Folder:
- Used MATLAB to simulate time series data.
  - Created white noise, pink noise (1/f), ongoing stationary/non-stationary sinewaves, transient oscillations with a Gaussian.
  - The purpose of this project was the simulate “realistic” EEG data so that it can be used to validate data analysis methods. 

EEG Graphing Folder:
- Used MATLAB to quantify features of an ERP graph.
  - Quantified the magnitude of a peak in an unfiltered ERP graph during a predefined time window.
  - Quantified the “mean-peak” (-10/+10 ms) magnitude in an unfiltered ERP graph during a predefined time window.
  - Applied a low-pass filter and repeated the previous two tasks.  
- Used MATLAB to generate a topographical map that shows peak time latency for each channel during a predefined time window.
